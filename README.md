## Abstract

Our solution is based on IoT (smart devices that automate the process) and blockchain (that ensures transparency and prevents/detects fraud). We believe our solution is awesome because:
IoT enabled smart devices that automate the process involved in the construction cycle ranging from the procurement of materials to power consumption etc.
A decentralized blockchain ensures that every transaction in the process is transparent and consistent. Any fraud or tampering would lead to inconsistent blocks, hence triggering detection of a possible illegal activity.
Smart Contracts form the core of the system. By using Smart Contracts and creating DAOs for a project, the administrative load on reporting, governance, monitoring responsibilities and transfer of risk can be reduced.

## How will our product be useful for HILTI ?

As of now, we have proposed a decentralised system of raw material and power management in the initial stages of construction process. These two test cases have been discussed below :-


Raw Material Management System
    
As we all know, the process of raw material management is quite 
cumbersome since it requires certification from approved companies and 
individuals. Along with this, there    have been multiple cases of corruption in 
this phase. So to tackle these problems, we propose a system wherein the 
entire transaction starting from shipping of raw materials to their delivery gets 
deployed on a private blockchain. Since the transaction is deployed on a 
private blockchain, it is transparent and involves a consensus mechanism for 
execution and validation using the digital identity of the concerned people 
from the company.

Power Management System
    
The main problems with the existing infrastructure are :-

- Billing process requires manual intervention.
- Electricity bill may not be paid on time by the buyer.
- Unethical management of units by the concerned power board.

All these problems can be catered making use of the blockchain and DAPP 
(Decentralised Applications) technology.
